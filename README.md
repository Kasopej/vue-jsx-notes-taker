# webpack-simple

> A simple Vue 2 note taking app, built using jsx syntax

> Does not need vue-loader or vue-template-compiler, making compilation very fast & lightweight. Uses babel (babel-plugin-transform-vue-jsx) to transpile jsx to vnodes


## Usage

- $ npm install
- $ npm run dev (live development server)
- $ npm run build (minified build for deployment)
